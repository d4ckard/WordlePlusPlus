# Wordle++

Terminal based Wordle clone, made with c++.

## Installation

To install this game, it can be downloaded as a binary (either macOs or Linux) and then executed it in a terminal.

Otherwise the repository can be cloned and compiled from source. word_lists.cpp should be compiled to an *.o or *.obj file first,
as it contains all possible words and takes a while to compile. A compiled version of this file can be found in the bin folder.


## Usage

Execute the binary. 
> : )


The rules of the game match the original's rules. 
If the entered word, is not allowed (misspelled or unknown) nothing will happen.

By changing 'game_length', the amount of rounds can be changed, dynamically.
The colors for the different clues in the game can be changed in 'headers/colors.h'.
